# Speech Recognizer/ Digital Assistant
# _______________________________________________
/!\The project is not over yet./!\

This is a Digital Assistant, launch the program (digital_assistant.py) talk to the computer and the script will recognize what you just said and will execute the command.

(This is a hard coding, not a machine learning version.)
# _______________________________________________

Module Needed:
- pip3 install requests
- pip3 install speech_recognition
- pip3 install pyttsx3
- pip3 install pyaudio
- pip3 install pyjoke

# I uploade a video when I run the program:

Let me know what you think, and any ideas for improve the script are welcome. 

(first version, this is not the version uploade on GitHub)
